# Raft Golang Implementation

## Implementation Steps

Here are the general steps you can follow to implement Raft in Go:

* State Machine: Define a struct that represents the state machine, which stores and updates the state of the system. The state machine can include fields such as the current term, the leader state, and the log entries.

* Raft Nodes: Define a struct for each Raft node, which represents a separate goroutine running the Raft algorithm. Each Raft node struct can include fields such as the state machine, the current term, the vote for, and the leader state.

* Message passing: Use Go channels to implement message passing between the Raft nodes. Each Raft node can have its own channels for sending and receiving messages, such as vote requests, append entries, and heartbeats.

* Leader Election: Implement the leader election process using a combination of timers, votes, and message passing. Each Raft node can have a timer that triggers a new election if no leader is found within a certain period of time.

* Log Replication: Implement the log replication process using a combination of message passing and state machine updates. The leader node sends append entries messages to the other nodes in the cluster, which then update their state machines accordingly.

* Safety and Liveness properties: Implement the safety and liveness properties to ensure the reliability and consistency of the system. This can include implementing mechanisms such as leader timeouts, quorum-based voting, and dynamic membership changes.

* Snapshotting and Log Compaction: Implement mechanisms to periodically save a snapshot of the state machine and compact the log entries in order to keep the memory usage in check and improve the performance.

* API: Finally, provide an API for clients to interact with the system, such as submitting commands and querying the state of the system.
