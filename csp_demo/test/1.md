# Multiple Sender Send to A Channel

## Error Code

```golang
// It is saved as main.go
func main() {
	arr := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	c := make(chan int, 5)
	fin := make(chan int, 3)
	cl := make(chan int, 1)
	wg := new(sync.WaitGroup)
	var once = new(sync.Once)

	defer close(cl)

	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		for _, ch := range arr {
			c <- ch
		}
		close(c)
		wg.Done()
	}()

	wg.Add(3)
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		go func() {
			for {
				if classId, ok := <-c; ok {
					// time.Sleep(time.Second)
					fin <- classId
				} else {
					break
				}
			}
			once.Do(func() { close(fin) })
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		for classId := range fin {
			fmt.Printf("classId %d finished \n", classId)
		}
		cl <- 1
	}()
	cl <- 1
	<-cl
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("all done")
}
```

When we compile and run the program with the following command,

```golang
go build -race main.go
./main
```

we find the program is error.

```shell
classId 1 finished 
classId 2 finished 
classId 3 finished 
panic: send on closed channel
```

And the error stack tells us that the line code 'fin - classId' is the root cause. Why?

## Root Cause

This is because multiple goroutines are writing to the channel `fin` and closing it at the same time. When the channels are ready, you can use a select to select one of them. On the receiving side you can use a select to pick from each channel when they are ready. 

## Best Practice

You can have multiple channels instead of having multiple writers to the same channel.

## Modification

```golang
func main() {
    arr := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    c := make(chan int, 5)
    fin := make(chan int, 3)
    wg := new(sync.WaitGroup)

    wg.Add(1)
    go func() {
        for _, ch := range arr {
            c <- ch
        }
        close(c)
        wg.Done()
    }()

    wg.Add(3)
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            for classId := range c {
                fin <- classId
            }
        }()
    }
    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        close(fin)
    }()
    for classId := range fin {
        fmt.Printf("classId %d finished \n", classId)
    }
    fmt.Println("all done")
}
```

In this modification, we added a new goroutine in the main function, which will wait for the completion of all the goroutines that are reading from the channel c and writing to the channel fin before closing the channel fin.
By doing this, we are making sure that all the goroutines have finished reading from channel c and writing to channel fin, and thus avoiding any race conditions.

It's always a good practice to test the code with sample inputs and expected outputs to confirm it works as expected.
